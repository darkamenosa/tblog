## Introduction

This project is build on [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). It will start a proxy server (on port **3001**) for hot reload React and exchange data with our `server`.

## Quick start

Run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
   *We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`*<br />
   *At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3001`.*

Now you're ready to rumble!
