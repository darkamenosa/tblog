## Introduction

After spending a few weeks on reading other people repos, I deciced to clean up this repository. It was a kind of shjt, with many redudant things. Keeping things small and precise is my current goal. 

Reading [Brent Jackson](https://github.com/jxnblk)'s code is really exciting. I learned a lot from his repositories.
