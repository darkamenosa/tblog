## Introduction

At the beginning, this project was just an assignment on an interview. The requirement was to build a blog with few basic functionalities.

I thought it was a boring requirement (it really was). I got an idea "Why don't I put some more functional requirements and make something really interesting? What will happen if I can earn money from this project?"

I will put these ideas here later. This is just a start for my project.

## Technical choice

On an interview, a technical leader said to me that *"NodeJS makes development faster, b/c it's easy to learn and has a lot of support tools"*. Most of the time I work with Java(Spring framework) and React stuffs, so I decide to try **NodeJS** for backend and **React** for frontent. Let's see how fast it is.

After spending few days to read some books, articles, repositories related to NodeJS, I got my stack.

- Webclient: React

	+ [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)

- Server: ExpressJS

	+ [js-stack-from-scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)
